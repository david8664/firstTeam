# firstTeam
we are the first team, which is the best team.
### why, you ask?
well, there is not a definitive answer. you just have to take my word on that one.
### what are we doing here?
we are practicing our ability to work with git. we aggregate all of our memory games we built with vanilla js and dom manipulation. its like a graveyard for our time with dom manipulation, which we hope to not come back to in any future period of our life.
